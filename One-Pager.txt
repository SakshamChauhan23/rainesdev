Absolutely. Below is a **simple, execution-ready PRD** — scoped strictly to MVP, clean enough for engineers, and clear enough for stakeholders.

You can paste this directly into **Notion / Google Docs / Jira**.

# **PRD — AI Agent Marketplace (MVP)**

## **1. Platform Idea**

Build a curated marketplace where AI Engineers can list **ready-to-use AI agent workflows**.
Buyers can discover, purchase, and unlock **step-by-step setup guides**.
Optional **paid tech support** helps buyers implement agents without friction.

The platform does **not host or execute agents**. It acts as:

* Discovery layer
* Trust & quality layer
* Knowledge delivery layer
* Support enablement layer
